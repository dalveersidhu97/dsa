- Prim’s Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)
- A* Pathfinding Algorithm
- Kruskal’s Algorithm (with Union-Find)
- Tarjan’s Algorithm (Strongly Connected Components)

- Rabin-Karp Algorithm
- Heavy-Light Decomposition (HLD)
- Mo’s Algorithm

## How to Use

### Cloning the Repository
To get started, clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dalveersidhu97/dsa.git  
cd dsa
```

### Running Code
Install ts-node package to run typescript files.
Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in separate files. To run a specific implementation, use:
```sh
ts-node <FILE_PATH>  # Example for Red-Black Tree
```
